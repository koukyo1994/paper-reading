# paper-reading

Repository for paper summary.
Each directory specifies the topic field, paper summary markdowns are inside those.
Paper summary follows the ["Ochiai" format](http://lafrenze.hatenablog.com/entry/2015/08/04/120205).

Some directories may contain reproductive implementations of those papers.
So far, we've implemented:

1. [Interaction Networks for Learning about Objects, Relations and Physics](relation-learning/IN)
